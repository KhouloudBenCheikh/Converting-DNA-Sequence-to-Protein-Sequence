# Converting-DNA-Sequence-to-Protein-Sequence
The process of going from DNA to Protein involves transcription, RNA processing, translation, and protein folding. 

First, DNA is transcribed into an RNA molecule, which is processed into mature mRNA that contains only protein-coding regions. 

The mature mRNA is then translated into a protein by Ribosomes, which read the mRNA in groups of 3 nucleotides called "Codons". 

Transfer RNA brings the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked together to form a protein chain. 

These steps can be modeled in Python code using  Biopython library provides tools for DNA sequence manipulation.
